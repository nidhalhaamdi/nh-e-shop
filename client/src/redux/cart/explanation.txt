So, what we did was we had to make sure that we added the new value, which was our cart items that 
we were trying to track into our initial state of our reducer.
Then we had to make a new action that was going to represent what we were trying to do to modify that
new property, which is our car items array.
Next, we define the actual action itself, which is addItem, which is a function that gets the
item and generates this new action with the action type of ADD_ITEM that we just made, passing the item
in as the payload, which our reducer then has to listen for with the new case, for that new action
type that we just made, so that whenever the action comes in, we make sure that what we're doing as
we're returning the new state of our overall cart reducer.
So it has whatever existing hidden value is there except the cart items array is a new array.
We have to make sure it's a new array.
Where we spread in the existing cart items, except we append the new item that we get as a payload
in at the end of this array.
Finally, we have to make sure that we update our actual collection item.
So that it pulls in to its props using the new map dispatch to props, where we make sure that when
we define the actual ad item itself, it's a function that gets whatever we want to pass in as the payload
in as the property.
